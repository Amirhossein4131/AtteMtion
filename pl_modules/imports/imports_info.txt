So far, two predefined geometric GNNs have been imported: DimeNet and MXMNet.
These are expected to be much more effective than the GAT and GCN networks pulled from torch_geometric.

MXMNet makes for a useful comparison for QM9, but it has not been adapted for crystal graphs (utilization of to_jimages).
It also has several drawbacks that might make it difficult to use it: it conducts a global message passing based on
the coordinates of atoms. This dynamic edge assignment also omits the entirety of pymatgen's CrystalNN framework,
which aims to utilize different translated views of the same atom to create a set of interactions. Using both approaches
together (CrystalNN and MXMNet) needs deep refactorization of at least one of them and - in the light of other options
- seems just not worth it.

DimeNet has been adapted for the usage of molecular graphs. If to_jimages are present, the availability of corresponding
lattice vectors is assumed. If they are absent, an error is raised, otherwise, they are consistently used to produce
geometric features of the structure graph.

Example initializations of MXMNet and DimeNet have been added in the configuration files: conf\grzegorz\model\model
